This is a food and cooking blog that I made after getting a assigment from my school.

## Description

This blog is created so that I can share my recipes with friends and family. It was made after I received an assignment to create a blog, but I had the freedom to choose the content. I specifically chose food and baking since it's something I enjoy, allowing me to continue working on this blog beyond the assignment's completion. The goal is to feature all of my recipes on the blog.

It is built using HTML and styled with CSS. I have utilized Javascript to fetch the blog posts from a headless Wordpress REST API. My future goal is to create a filter() method to enable recipe searches. Additionally, I aim to allow users of the site to leave comments and possibly send messages directly to me.
